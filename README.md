# Introduction
This project is part of the Foundation of Data Engineering course in [INSA Lyon](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/en/). 
The goal of this project is to build multiple data pipelines to process data from the weather and the bus delay time in Toronto from 2017 to 2022 and make it available for analysis.

# Architecture
The architecture of this project is shown in the figure below. The data is ingested from the [Toronto Open Data](https://open.toronto.ca/) and [Open Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs), is then processed by the data pipeline. The data is then available for analysis.

## Airflow
The data pipeline are built using [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/). The data pipeline is built using the [DAG](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts.html#dags) concept in Airflow. The DAGs are defined in the `dags` folder.

## Pipeline API
Pipeline API is a Restful API that is built using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/). The API is used to trigger the data pipeline and to get the status of the data pipeline. The API is defined in the `pipeline_api` folder.
API Documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/5IF-Data-Engineering/pipeline-api/blob/main/README.md#api-documentation).

## Star Schema
The data is stored in the [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database. The data is stored in the star schema, and is shown in the figure below.

# Pipelines
The data pipeline is divided into 4 stages: Ingestion, Staging, Enrichment, and Production.

## Ingestion
The bus delay time data is ingested from the 6 Excel spreadsheets from [Toronto Open Data](https://open.toronto.ca/). When the data is ingested, 
it is also stored in the Redis database to speed up the data pipeline. We divide also the data by year to speed up the data pipeline. The data pipeline is shown in the figure below.

![Bus ingestion](./assets/bus_ingestion.png)

Each year, we divide the bus data into 4 parts: January to March, April to June, July to September, and October to December. Each part is then processed in parallel. Inside each task, we consider that they are the small ETL pipelines. The small ETL pipelines are triggered by
the API call, defined inside the BashOperator. Each BashOperator will execute the Shell script to process the data. The Shell script is defined in the `./airflow/scripts` folder.
Inside each small ETL pipeline that we define inside the `pipeline_api`, the data is extracted from [Open Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs), then transformed using Pandas, and finally loaded into the MongoDB database. We choose the MongoDB database for the ingestion stage because it is a NoSQL database and flexible, 
which is suitable for storing the raw data.

The weather data is ingested from the [Open Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs). The data is ingested using the [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/) API. The data is then stored in the MongoDB database. The idea of the data pipeline is much similar to the bus delay time data ingestion. We divide the data by year. We then process the data in parallel. The weather data is also transformed using Pandas and loaded into the MongoDB database.

## Staging

We want to extract the data from the MongoDB database, transform it, and load it into the PostgreSQL database. We choose the PostgreSQL database for the staging stage because it is a relational database, which is suitable for storing the structured data. The data pipeline is shown in the figure below.

![Bus staging](./assets/bus_staging.png)

First, we have to create a table for storing staging data. We extract the data from the MongoDB database. We then aggregate the data by the time, the location and the incident using the MongoDB queries. The aggregated data is loaded into the PostgreSQL database. The DAGs are defined inside the `dags` folder. And the ETL pipelines are triggered by API calling, defined inside the `pipeline_api` folder.

## Enrichment

We extract the bus delay data and the weather data from the PostgreSQL database, then join them together.

## Production

# Future development
- [ ] Add more data sources
- [ ] Add more data pipelines
- [ ] Add more data analysis
- [ ] Add more data visualization

# Project Submission Checklist
- [ ] Repository with the code, well documented
- [x] Docker-compose file to run the environment
- [ ] Detailed description of the various steps
- [x] Report with the project design steps divided per area
- [x] Example dataset: the project testing should work offline, i.e., you need to have some sample data points.
- [ ] Slides for the project presentation. You can do them too in markdown too.
- [ ] Use airflow + pandas + mongodb + postgres + neo4j
- [x] Using REDIS for speeding up steps
- [x] STAR schema design includes maintenance upon updates
- [ ] Creativity: data viz, serious analysis, performance analysis, extensive cleansing.
- [x] Launching docker containers via airflow to schedule job

# How to run
## Automated
Clone the repository using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/5IF-Data-Engineering/deng-project.git
```
Update the submodules using the following command:
```bash
git submodule sync --recursive
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
Using this command to run the data pipeline:
```bash
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

## Manual
Clone the repository using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/5IF-Data-Engineering/deng-project.git
```
Update the submodules using the following command:
```bash
git submodule sync --recursive
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
Find the process id of the user using the following command:
```bash
id -u
```
Enter the process id of the user in the `.env` file.
```
AIRFLOW_UID=${id -u}
```
Initialize the Airflow database using the following command:
```bash
docker-compose up airflow-init
```
If 0 is returned, it means that the Airflow database is initialized successfully. Otherwise, you have to remove the `tmp` folder and run the command again.

Add permission to execute for shell scripts
```bash
chmod +x ./airflow/scripts/*
```

After initializing the Airflow database, you can start the Airflow webserver and the scheduler using the following command:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
After starting the Airflow webserver and the scheduler, you can access the Airflow webserver at `http://localhost:8080/`. \
You can access the Pipeline API at `http://localhost:8000/`.

Create the staging and production database in the PostgreSQL using the following command:
```bash
docker exec -it postgres psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE deng_staging;"
docker exec -it postgres psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE deng_production;"
```

Add the following connections in the Airflow webserver:
- `postgres_staging`: PostgreSQL for staging connection
- `postgres_production`: PostgreSQL for production connection
```bash
docker exec -it airflow-webserver airflow connections add postgres_staging --conn-uri postgresql://postgres:@postgres:5432/deng_staging
docker exec -it airflow-webserver airflow connections add postgres_production --conn-uri postgresql://postgres:@postgres:5432/deng_production
```

You need to build the Star Schema image used by DockerOperator using the following command:
```bash
docker build -t nmngo248/star-schema:latest ./star_schema
```

After running all the enrichment & production pipeline, if you want to extract the csv files from the PostgreSQL database, you can use the following command:
```bash
docker cp postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data/*.csv /path/to/your/folder
```
